JavaScript and the DOM - 2 Practice 2: Quiz App

Instructions
Create an interactive quiz application that uses event handlers to capture user
input, dynamically update the DOM, and provide feedback to the user. This activity
will help students practice managing events, dynamically manipulating the DOM,
and attaching/removing event listeners.
===== TASKS =====
1. HTML Setup:
Create a basic HTML structure with the following elements:
● The question text.
● Four buttons for answer choices.
● An element to display feedback after an answer is selected.
● A “Next Question” button to move onto the next question.

2. JavaScript Functionality:
● Display Question:
  ○ Use an array of question objects, each containing:
    ■ A question string.
    ■ An array of four answer choices.
    ■ The index of the correct answer.
● Handle Answer Selection:
  ○ Add click event listeners to the answer buttons.
  ○ When a button is clicked, check if the selected answer is correct and update the feedback element accordingly.
  ○ Disable all answer buttons after a selection to prevent further clicks.
● Next Question:
  ○ Attach an event listener to the "Next Question" button.
  ○ When clicked, load the next question and re-enable the answer buttons.
